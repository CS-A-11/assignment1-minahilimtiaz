I have found this assignment very interesting as it helped me to practice the skills of HTML i learnt in class.



The idea of the instructor to test the HTML skills of students by asking them to write their CV is innovative. 




This assignment was not only for testing skills but to prepare students for professional enivronment .



This was a new experience for me . I enjoyed learning HTML and googling for new ideas.
